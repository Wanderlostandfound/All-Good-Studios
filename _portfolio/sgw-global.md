Global communications companies are usually located in anonymous and bland facilities. [SGW](http://www.sgwglobal.com/) have a London base that is more cool studio than mundane office.<br><br>

A concise 10 week programme saw an empty canal side industrial shell transformed into a cool, contemporary, efficient workplace. The informal calm belies the fact that Branch Place is a powerfully connected technological hub. This duality is something we pursue in our work.<br><br>

A concise programme and stringent budget necessitated Jackdaw Studios implementing a Design and Build contract. This enabled very precise responsive project management. An important factor in achieving a confident, beautifully executed result. <br><br>
